## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

This is the classic snake game (arcade category) that everyone knows and loves! You move around with the
arrow keys, and try to snag the fruit (indicated by boxes that aren't attached to your body).
This helps you grow! There is a restart button that lets you start form the beginning
whenever you want, and an exit button when you think you're done for the day! Try to fill
the whole screen with that slithery body of yours!

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working

I learned a little bit about game design and some elegant solutions to
problems I was trying to solve, which I really enjoyed. I also feel like
I really solidified my skills with javafx in this project so I'm
super happy about that.

## Part 3: Retrospect

For whatever reason, I began with the game logic, and waited to render
things until the very end. Thankfull I had done it correctly, but I feel
like it would have been a lot more stress free if I had tried rendering
things as I made them along the way to make sure everything worked together.
